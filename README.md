# FCC: Random Quote Machine

This is a random quote generator made as part of the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certification Curriculum.

I used ReactJS, CSS and Bootstrap styling, and a JSON API to build and implement the quote generator. There is a button to share the quote onto twitter.

It is also uploaded online at: https://codepen.io/btruo/pen/gOdaxGK
